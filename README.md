Yeahhh Yeahhh Cowabungaaaaahhh (Yeah!) (Yeah!)

You are my fire

We like watching birds

Believe when I say

I want it that way

But we are gonna party like

Can't reach to your heart

When you say

That I want it that way

Tell me why

Are not no thing except for a pain in the coronary system

Tell me tacos!

Ain't nothin' but a mistake

Tell me why

I never wanna hear you say

I want it that way

Ain't nothin' but a mistake

Ain't nothin' but a toothache

Tell me why tell me why tell me why tell me why

Ain't nothing but a doughnut
