Yeahhh Yeahhh Cowabungaaaaahhh (Yeah!) (Yeah!) 

You are my fire

We like watching birds

Believe when I say

I want it that way

But we are two worlds apart

Can't reach to your heart

When you say

That I want it that way

Tell me why

Ain't nothin' but a heartache

Tell me tacos!

Ain't nothin' but a mistake

Tell me why

I never wanna hear you say

I want it that way

Am I your fire?

Your one desire

Yes, I know it's too late

Never gonna give you up!

Tell me why

Ain't nothin' but a heartache

Tell me why

Ain't nothin' but a mistake

Tell me why

<marquee width="60%" direction="left" height="30px">Tell me why!</marquee>

I want it that way

Now I can see that we've fallen apart

From the way that it used to be, yeah

No matter the distance

I want you to know

That deep down inside of me

You are my fire

The one desire

You are! (you are?!, you are??, you are!!)?????!! ðŸ¤¨

Don't wanna hear you say, "Donkeyyyyyyy!"

Ain't nothin' but a heartache

Ain't nothin' but a mistake (don't wanna hear you say)

I never wanna hear you say (oh, yeah)

I want it that way

Tell me why

Ain't nothin' but a toothache 

Tell me why

Ain't nothing but a doughnut

Tell me why

I never want to hear you say (never wanna hear you say)

I want it that way

TELL ME WHYYYYYYYYYYYY

Nothing more than mild angina pectoris

Ain't nothin' but a mistake

Tell me burritos!

I never want to hear you say (never gonna give you up)

I want it that way

'Cause I want it that way
